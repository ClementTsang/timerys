# Timerys

A simple cross-platform timer app. Created as a study of [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) and because I
wanted a very simple timer application.

This can be a lot prettier but some cosmetic details I want to add are not easy to do in iced as of writing -
though I imagine it'll get better soon!
